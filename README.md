# BudgetPal

**BudgetPal** is a personal finance management application designed to help users track their income and expenses, set financial goals, and visualize their financial balance in real-time.

## Features

- **Balance Overview**: Displays income, expense, and overall balance in real-time.
- **Transaction History**: View the list of all transactions added, with the ability to delete them.
- **Transaction Form**: Allows users to input new transactions (income or expense).
- **Scrollable History**: Transaction history is scrollable and dynamically updates as new transactions are added.
- **Budget Goals**: Set and track financial goals, helping you save for future purchases.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React.js
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Vite (for fast bundling)

- **Backend**: 
  - None (this app is client-side only)
